excerpt: 'On the one hand, applied topology is a new Field of study, the purpose of which is to develop topological and related concepts for data analysis and other "real-world" problems. On the other hand, for some time probabilists have been using topological notions as a means to study the properties of random Fields, in particular, the properties of the Euler characteristic. This connection between probability and topology is advantageous for both Fields, and allows the further expansion of applied topology, increasing its ability to address the uncertainties of the "real world".

The Euler integral is a good example of the kind
of tools used by applied topology and is a relatively old concept built on the topological notion of Euler-Poincare characteristics. It exploits the inclusion-exclusion property of the Euler characteristic to define an integration-like operation on functions on topological spaces. Euler integrals of deterministic functions have recently been shown to have a wide variety of possible applications, including signal processing, data aggregation and network sensing. Adding random noise to these scenarios, as is natural in the majority of applications, leads to a need for statistical analysis, the first step of which requires asymptotic distribution results for estimators. The first such result is provided in this paper, as a central limit theorem for the Euler integral of pure, Gaussian, noise fields.'
