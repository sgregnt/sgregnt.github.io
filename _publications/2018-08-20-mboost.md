excerpt: 'This paper is about *application of applied topology to visualize operation of neural network*. This extended abstract reports work in progress on a topology based approach to the problem of profiling, diagnosing and refining black-box models, with particular emphasis on deep neural networks. The proposed method is named M-Boost and relies on the mapper algorithm from topology, recursively identifying groups of observations where the accuracy can be improved.
