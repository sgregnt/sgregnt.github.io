excerpt: 'This paper is about **random Gaussian fields in the context of applied topology**.

Applied topology is a new field of study, the purpose of which is to use abstract topological notion for data analysis and other ``real-world" problems. 

The Euler integral is a good example of the kind
of tools developed within applied topology and is a relatively old concept built on the topological notion of Euler-Poincare characteristics. It exploits the inclusion-exclusion property of the Euler characteristic to define an integration-like operation on functions on topological spaces. Euler integrals of deterministic functions have recently been shown to have a wide variety of possible applications, including signal processing, data aggregation and network sensing. Adding random noise to these scenarios, as is natural in the majority of applications, leads to a need for statistical analysis, the first step of which requires asymptotic distribution results for estimators. The first such result is provided in this paper, as a central limit theorem for the Euler integral of pure, Gaussian, noise fields.'
