I'm studying towards a PhD degree at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), in the depatment of [Statistics](https://galton.uchicago.edu/). My research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Lek-Heng Lim.](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/)

I'm interested in applying non-standard tools form abstract algebra and topolgy to the study of neural networks. 


### Announcements and latest whereabouts
- (_new_) I'm organizing [2019 SIAM Minisymposium  on application of tropical
geometry for machine learning](http://wiki.siam.org/siag-ag/index.php/SIAM_AG_19_Proposed_Minisymposia) (with focus on deep neural networks) [(SIAM AG19)](https://www.siam.org/Conferences/CM/Main/ag19). 
- (_new_) I'm participating in [Oberwolfach Seminar: Mathematics of Deep Learning](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/1842b/www_view) taking place this Oct 14-20, in [Oberwolfach, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberwolfach). 
- (_new_) During the summer of 2018  I've spent wonderful time working as a PhD machine learning intern in Blink startup (2018 Haifa, Israel) working with Caffe, Theano and TensorFlow.  


## Most recent research projects

* [Tropical algebra and tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry) of deep neural network.   
In our latest work, presented this year at ICML conference in Stockholm, we've establish connections
between feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation and tropical
geometry. We've shown that the family of such neural networks is equivalent
to the family of tropical rational maps. This novel connection between two previously distinct areas of research allowed us to use machinery of tropical algebraic geometry for the study of neural networks.

* Topological data analysis to boost performance of neural networks. 
[Topological data analysis (TDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) is a relatively
new area of research that has rapidly developed in the past decade. TDA
uses ideas from topology to analyses point cloud data. In my older work
I've considered TDA in a settings where point cloud data is
contaminated by a noise and proved a theoretical convergence results for
a Euler integral. In a recent project that I work on, we show how TDA can be used for profiling
of neural network operation and boosting its performance. The profiling
is done using the mapper algorithm [G Singh et. al., 2007](https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf), the algorithm provides topological
summary for the data shape, in the form of simplex or a graph, the shape
of the data is used to measure local performance of neural network on
diferent regions in the input and  then device an assembly scheme that improves
neural network performance.

## Past research interests

- In the past I worked in logic design and hardware engineering. 
-- I did a research project at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/) where we designed [a near real time logic circuit for RSA encryption](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5386066). 
-- For the period between 2006-2015 year I worked as a board designer and FPGA engineer and team leader.
