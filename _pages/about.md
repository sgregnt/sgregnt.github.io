I am studying towards a PhD degree at the University of Chicago, in the depatment of Statistics. My research is conducted under supervision of Prof. Lek-Heng Lim.

I'm interested in applying non standard tools form abstract algebra and topology to the study of theory and applications of neural networks. Two areas that I'm currently most interested in are: 

* Tropical algebra and tropical geometry of deep neural network.

* Topological data analysis to boost performance of neural networks.
