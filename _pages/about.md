I'm studying towards a PhD degree at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), in the depatment of [Statistics](https://galton.uchicago.edu/). My research is conducted under supervision of [Prof. Lek-Heng Lim.](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/)

## The latest anouncments and whereabouts
- __new__ I'm organizing 2019 SIAM mini-seminar on application of tropical
geometry for machine learning (with focus on deep neural networks). 
- __new__ I'm participating in [Oberwolfach Seminar: Mathematics of Deep Learning](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/1842b/www_view) taking place this 14-20 Oct, 2018. 


## Research interest and latest professional experiences 

I'm interested in applying non standard tools form abstract algebra and topolgy to the study of neural networks. Two most recent project that I work on now are:

* [Tropical algebra and tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry) of deep neural network.   
   - In our latest work, presented this year at ICML conference in Stockholm, we've establish connections
between feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation and tropical
geometry|we show that the family of such neural networks is equivalent
to the family of tropical rational maps. This novel connection between two previously distinct areas of research allowed us to use machinery of tropical algebraic geometry for the study of neural networks.

* Topological data analysis to boost performance of neural networks.

   - [Topological data analysis (TDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) is a relatively
new area of research that has rapidly developed in the past decade. TDA
uses ideas from topology to analyses point cloud data. In my older work
I've considered TDA in a settings where point cloud data is
contaminated by a noise and proved a theoretical convergence results for
a Euler integral. In a recent project that I work on, we show how TDA can be used for proling
of neural network operation and boosting its performance. The profiling
is done using the mapper algorithm (G Singh,2007)[https://research.math.osu.edu/tgda/mapperPBG.pdf], the algorithm provides topological
summary for the data shape, in the form of simplex or a graph, the shape
of the data is used to measure local performance of neural network on
diferent regions in the input and  then device an assembly scheme that improves
neural network performance.

During the summer of 2017 and 2018 I've spand wonderful time working as doctoral machine learning intern working on deep learning in (SAS institute)[https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html] (2017, Cary, NC, US) and in Blink startup (2018 Haifa, Israel) working with Caffe, Theano and tensorflow.  

# Past research interest and work expirience. 

In the past I worked in logic design and hardware engineering. This started with research project at the Techinion Israel where we designed a (near real time logic circuit for RSA enchription)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5386066]. For the next 9 year I worked as a board designer and FPGA engineer.
